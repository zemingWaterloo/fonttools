handling of IF_ELSE blocks does not work,because:

1. line 1202,  when handling IF instruction, unexpected environment restoration
 to IF. This causes crushes in some cases.

2. line 1219,  when handlign an if-else block, the EIF instruction is visited
 twice.The code merges the 2 environment when handling EIF for the second time. This causes crush for IF-mode. and for ELSE-mode,this is not necessssary

3. line 1280,  unexpected environment merge,if this part is working properly, (2) should not do the repeat job

4. line 1286,  unexpected environment restoration

5. line 1301,  the block of code handling the exiting of if-else block is
   moved to here,it will not be ever called before

6. line 1320,  add code which assign the current_instruction to proper one
   when quiting if block/the whole if-else block, the program would stuck 
   there before

7. line 291,   append intermediate code for IF/ELSE/EIF , it printed nothing before


8.  add 10 more tests for if-else
